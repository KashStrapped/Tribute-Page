    <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Robin Williams' career:</h3>
    <ul>
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Birth</h2>
      <li>
        <strong>1951</strong> - Robin McLaurin Williams was born in Chicago, Illinois on July 21, 1951. His father, Robert Williams, was a senior executive in Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury Division. His mother, Laurie McLaurin, was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi. Through her, he was a great-great-grandson of Mississippi senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin. Williams had two elder half-brothers; paternal half-brother Robert (also known as Todd) and maternal half-brother McLaurin. He had English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, French, and German ancestry.</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Moving to Detroit</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1963</strong> - In late 1963, when Robin was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. the family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on 20 acres in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he was a student at the private Detroit Country Day School. He excelled in school, where he was on the school's wrestling team and was elected class president.</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">High School Graduation</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1969</strong> - As both his parents worked, Robin was attended to by the family's maid, who was his main companion. When Robin was 16, his father took early retirement and the family moved to Marin County, settling in Tiburon, California. Following their move, Robin attended Redwood High School in Nearby Larkspur. At the time of his graduation in 1969, he was voted "Most Likely Not to Succeed" and "Funniest" by his classmates.</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Enrolled in Claremont Men's College</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1970s</strong> - After high school graduation, Williams enrolled at Claremont Men's College in Claremont, California, to study political science; he dropped out to pursue acting. Robin studied theatre for three years at the College of Marin, a community college in Kentfield, California. According to the College of Marin's drama professor James Dunn, the depth of the young actor's talent became evident when he was cast in the musical Oliver! as Fagin. Robin often improvised during his time in the drama program, leaving cast members in hysterics. Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her that Robin "was going to be something special".</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Full Scholarship to the Juilliard School</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1973</strong> - In 1973, Robin attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6, 1973 - 1976) in New York City. He was one of the 20 students accepted into the freshman class and one of two accepted by John Houseman into the Advanced Program at the school that year; the other was Christopher Reeve. William Hurt and Mandy Patinkin were also classmates. According to biographer Jean Dorsinville, Franklyn Seales and Robin were roommates at Juilliard.</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Reeve's Friendship</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1970s</strong> - Robin and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said wa sone of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. According to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Robin, who could instantly perform in many accents, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahm, who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo". Robin already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Robin silenced his critics with his well-received performance as an old man in The Night of the Iguana by Tennessee Williams. "He simply was the old man," wrote Reeve. "I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Leaving Juilliard</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1976</strong> - During the summers of 1974, 1975 and 1976, Robin worked as a busser at The Trident in Sausalito, California. He left Juilliard during his junior year in 1976 at the suggestion of Houseman, who said there was nothing more Juilliard could teach him. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, said that Robin was a "genius" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; no one was suprised that he left.</li>
      
      <h2 id=timeline-heading>First Performances</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1970s</strong> - Robin began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-1970s. He gave his first performance at the Holy City Zoo, a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar. In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the late 1970s, Robin helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes critic Gerald Nachman. Robin says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud".</li>
     
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Moving to Los Angeles</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1977</strong> - Robin moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including The Comedy Store. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer George Schlatter, who asked him to appear on a revival of his show Laugh-In. The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance. That year, Robin also performed a show at the LA improv for Home Box Office. While the Laugh-In revival failed, it led Robin into his television career; he continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs such as the Roxy to help keep his impprovisational skill sharp.

Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Robin impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition. As Mork, Robin improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives, were deeply impressed with his performance.</li>
        
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">Mork & Mindy</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1978</strong> - Mork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom Mork & Mindy, which co-starred Pam Dawber, and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialog and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in Happy Days, the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in Milwaukee. Mork & Mindy at its peak had a weekly audience of 60 million and was credited with turning Robin into a "superstar." According to critic James Poniewozik, the series was especially popular among young people as Robin became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of the invention."</li>

The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets sold out within 30 minutes. In 1986, Robin released A Night at the Met.</li>
      
      <h2 id="timeline-heading">First Appearance on Time's Magazine</h2>
      
      <li>
        
        <strong>1979</strong> - Mork became popular, featured on posters, coloring books, lunch-boxes, and other merchandise.

The cover photo, taken by Michael Dressler in 1979, is said to have "his different sides: the funnyman mugging for the camera, and a sweet, more thoughtful pose that appears on a small TV he holds in his hands" according to Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times. This photo was installed in the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institution shortly after his death to allow visitors to pay their respects.
